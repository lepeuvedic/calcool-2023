blurb:
  heading: Why CalCool Studios
  text: CalCool Studios builds advanced small servers for AI, training of
    foundational models and interactive visualization. Or servers do not require
    a complex infrastructure. Relying on liquid cooling, they are silent enough
    to operate in office space, and they are powerful enough to tackle large
    problems. Finally we offer advanced networking for the users who need a
    small cluster.

values:
  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
